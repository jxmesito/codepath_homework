Regarding the exported JSON file, MHN-Admin provides the functionality to export data related to honeypot events and activities in JSON format. The exported JSON file typically includes information such as:

Sensor Data: Details about the honeypots deployed, including their sensor ID, IP address, location, and other relevant information.

Attack Data: Recorded information about the attacks detected by the honeypots. This may include the source IP address, attack type, timestamp, payload details, and other relevant data.

Session Data: Information about the sessions established with the honeypots, such as the source and destination IP addresses, protocols used, timestamps, and session-specific details.

Malware Samples: If configured, the exported JSON file may include information about any malware samples collected by the honeypots, such as file names, hashes, and associated metadata.

**Summary:** How did you find it? Which honeypot captured it? What does each malware do?

MD5 Hash: *Run `md5sum` on the file and record the hash here.*

SHA1 Hash: *Run `sha1sum` on the file and record the hash here.*
